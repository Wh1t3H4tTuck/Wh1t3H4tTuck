- 👋 Hi, I’m @Wh1t3H4tTuck
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to read/write code and become an ethical hacker. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning through the THM rooms, and have done self paced courses in python and JavaScript (python is better btw)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all things, the more I read the more I will learn. 
- 📫 Hit me up on twitter @JD_Tuccolo or LinkedIn JD Tuccolo
